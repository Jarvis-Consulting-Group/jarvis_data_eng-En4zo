The agent utilizes Bash scripts to gather hardware information from the machines, which is then securely stored in a PostgreSQL database that is provisioned using Docker. To ensure accurate and up-to-date information, resource usage is fetched at regular intervals using Crontab. The collected data can then be easily analyzed and manipulated using SQL queries, providing users with valuable insights and performance metrics for their Linux systems.",

Using DBeaver as an IDE, we practiced manipulating existing data and compared our query results with expected outcomes. The existing data was stored in a file, clubdata.sql, which was imported into a PostgreSQL database deployed in a Docker container. This hands-on approach allowed us to gain a practical understanding of the concepts and strengthen our skills in the field.",

        "Twitter App: Implementing a Java application that allows users to post, show, and delete tweets on Twitter using the Twitter REST API V2. The TwitterApp follows the MVC architecture, where the models encapsulate and manage Tweet objects that are displayed in JSON format. The controller layer interacts with client input (args), parses it, and calls the service layer to return results. The service layer handles the business logic and interacts with the DAO layer to communicate with the Twitter REST API. The data access layer (DAO) interacts with the Twitter REST API to perform post, show, and delete actions on tweets.To implement this design, we use Twitter REST API v2 and combine it with HTTP requests to perform the actions. We also use the OAuth 1.0a protocol to create an additional HTTP Authorization header to authorize HTTP requests. To convert JSON strings from HTTP responses to Tweet objects and vice versa, we use the fasterXML Jackson package. Springboot framework is used to manage dependencies and set dependencies via the class constructor. For testing, we utilize integration and unit testing with the libraries Mockito and JUnit4. To manage all the above dependency packages, we use Maven.Finally, we deploy the Twitter application within a Docker container and upload it to Dockerhub for easy use.",
        "JDBC App: Interacting with a PostgreSQL database using the JDBC API, this project implements standard CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the database, utilizing Java version 8. To simplify deployment, we create a container image using Docker to run PostgreSQL within it. The application uses java.sql packages to establish connections with the database and execute SQL statements to perform the CRUD operations. Our project code is managed using Git and GitHub, while dependencies such as the org.postgresql driver are managed using Maven.",
        "Grep App: Implementing the widely used Linux command grep in Java using Java 8. This project is designed for anyone who wants to quickly search for strings within files. With the grep app, users can filter files and find target strings more efficiently, thereby saving time. The project utilizes Java's Stream API and lambda functions for efficient string searching within files. Maven manages dependencies, including slf4j and log4j for log management. The Java Scanner and BufferedWriter classes are used to read and write data from and to files respectively. The project is built and packaged into a jar file using Maven, and the jar file is further packaged into a Docker image for easy deployment. The Docker image is available on Docker Hub for easy access."
